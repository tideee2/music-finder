# MusicFinder

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.1.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

If `ng serve` doesn't work (CORS errors), try run `ng serve --proxy proxy.conf.json`
 
or `npm run start-proxy`
